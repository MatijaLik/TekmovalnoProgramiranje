 
Configure Geany preferences:
5.1. Open preferences with ctrl+alt+P.
5.2. In Keybindings tab, set Switch to Editor as F1 and confirm overriding, then Switch to VTE as F2 (VTE is built-in terminal).
5.3. In Terminal tab, mark Follow path of the current file. Terminal will now automatically change a path after you open a new file.
5.4. (optional) In Editor tab, change Comment toggle marker to an empty string or a single space.
Open any C++ file in Geany, go to Build -> Set Build Commands and copy my flags.
Compile (F8): g++ -std=c++17 -Wshadow -Wall -o "%e" "%f" -O2 -Wno-unused-result
Build (F9): g++ -std=c++17 -Wshadow -Wall -o "%e" "%f" -g -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG
If you get compilation errors, try changing from c++17 to c++14 and/or removing sanitizers (two fsanitize flags).
If your computer beeps after compilation, unmark Beep on errors in Preferences -> General -> Miscellaneous.
Open a file ~/.bashrc and uncomment a line #force_color_prompt=yes in order to get colorful terminal in Geany. Restart geany or run source ~/.bashrc to trigger the change.
Optional steps that I use:

Hide Toolbar and Sidebar by unmarking them in View.
Install Guake and make it run on start-up:
sudo apt install guake
Activities (top-left corner) -> Startup Applications Preferences -> Add -> set name and command as guake
Open system settings (top-right corner of the screen) and mark Auto-hide the Dock in Dock tab.
More info and details below.

You can install stuff by using Software Center or typing a command in terminal, usually sudo apt install program_name. This should be displayed if you just type geany (Command 'geany' not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install geany). If this doesn't work, I usually google ubuntu how to install program_name from terminal and follow the instructions.
Guake allows you to summon a fullscreen terminal by clicking the F12 button, which is more comfortable than a new terminal window that you can open with ctrl+alt+T. It isn't important if you use Geany built-in terminal though.
Comment toggle marker refers to a special character added to comments created with shortcut ctrl+E in Geany. The default ~ means that commented lines will look like //~ int a = 2 + 2;. It's ok to get rid of the ~ character.
In Preferences -> Interface, you can switch the position of Geany terminal (and message window) between bottom and right.
